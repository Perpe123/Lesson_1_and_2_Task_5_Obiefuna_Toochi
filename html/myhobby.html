        <p>
            Everyone should have a hobby. Sketching and drawing can take my mind
            off anything that has been stressing me out. This is a hobby you can
            do at any time, it is not expensive. Sketching and drawing not only
            improve your creative skills but also help your aesthetic skills.
            These skills can be applied in a number of different areas in your
            life.

            Sketching is beneficial for wellness and holistic health. As your
            sketches become better and better, your confidence and self esteem
            increases. I feel a sense of satisfaction and achievement on
            completing a sketch. Feeling satisfied and confident goes a long way
            in improving your wellness quotient. You can draw just anything but
            personally, I love to draw human beings especially the female gender
            just like the one below.

            Human body is symmetric in nature and this was one of the challenges
            I faced while drawing as a child. Then, one hand or foot would
            always be bigger than the other, but now, I'd say I've become an
            expert in drawing. For me, drawing is everything and more. It's an
            amazing talent and a beautiful hobby. Watch the video below
